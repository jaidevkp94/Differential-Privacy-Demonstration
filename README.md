# Differential-Privacy-Demonstration
This is an introduction to implementing Differential Privacy in Python.

As the world continues to become increasingly digital, concerns over data privacy are higher than ever. Common forms of privacy protection, such as Data Anonymization, have proven archaic with countless examples of this protection being exploited via re-identification. The long-term solution to this exponentially relevant issue is Differential Privacy. Differential privacy is a framework to mathematically define the extent of privacy that can be provided when sharing sensitive information. In practice, differential privacy injects noise into sensitive data while maintaining statistical integrity & analytical utility.

The notebook demonstrates an implementation of Differential Privacy in Python through the PyDP package.
